    "Recall that Lending Club assigns a grade and a sub-grade based on the borrower's interest rate. While the grade and sub_grade values are categorical, the int_rate column contains continuous values, which are better suited for machine learning. The out_prncp and out_prncp_inv both describe the outstanding principal amount for a loan, which is the remaining amount the borrower still owes. These 2 columns as well as the total_pymnt column describe properties of the loan after it's fully funded and started to be paid off. This information isn't available to an investor before the loan is fully funded and we don't want to include it in our model. All of these columns leak data from the future, meaning that they're describing aspects of the loan after it's already been fully funded and started to be paid off by the borrower."

    "Unfortunately, using a random forest classifier didn't improve our false positive rate. The model is likely weighting too heavily on the 1 class, and still mostly predicting 1s. We could fix this by applying a harsher penalty for misclassifications of 0s.\n",

    "Ultimately, our best model had a false positive rate of 7%, and a true positive rate of 20%. For a conservative investor, this means that they make money as long as the interest rate is high enough to offset the losses from 7% of borrowers defaulting, and that the pool of 20% of borrowers is large enough to make enough interest money to offset the losses.\n",

    "If we had randomly picked loans to fund, borrowers would have defaulted on 14.5% of them, and our model is better than that, although we're excluding more loans than a random strategy would. Given this, there's still quite a bit of room to improve:\n",

    "* We can tweak the penalties further.\n",
    "* We can try models other than a random forest and logistic regression.\n",
    "* We can use some of the columns we discarded to generate better features.\n",
    "* We can ensemble multiple models to get more accurate predictions.\n",
    "* We can tune the parameters of the algorithm to achieve higher performance."
